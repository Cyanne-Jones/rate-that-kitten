# Rate! That! KITTEN!
### A cat pic rating application: an AI aided experiment 🐈
Using the CaaS (Cats as a Service) [Cat Api](https://thecatapi.com/), bring in photos of kitties so a user can rate them based on various attributes. 



Assume single user, and utilize local storage options (Zustand persistent store, IndexedDB etc) to persist a user's favorite highest-rated kitty cats. 
Keep adding functionality until it gets too unweildy and breaks, take note of triumps and struggles (for learning!)
