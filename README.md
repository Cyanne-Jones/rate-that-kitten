# Rate! That! KITTEN!
### A cat pic rating application: an AI aided experiment üêà
Using the CaaS (Cats as a Service) [Cat Api](https://thecatapi.com/), bring in photos of kitties so a user can rate them based on various attributes. 

Assume single user, and utilize local storage options (Zustand persistent store, IndexedDB etc) to persist a user's favorite highest-rated kitty cats. 
Keep adding functionality until it gets too unweildy and breaks, take note of triumps and struggles (for learning!)


## What we're workin with so far  üíÖüèº

### The good: 
- Quick general file structure
- Great grasp of React state management, quickly handles that functionality
- I love when animations are written for me, this is magic ‚ú®
- Gave commands to remove the node-modules mistakes without me having to Google

### The bad:
- No .gitignore, pushed node-modules (oof!)
- Installed create vite react-ts twice for two src files (yikes!)
- Waaaaaay overengineered styling. These CSS files are giant and kinda gross to work in
- Would overengineer solutions if I didn't keep my requests as strictly scoped as possible.

### Overall
I used gpt-4o-mini for free in Cursor with its Agent mode, and it performed pretty well, but was noticeably harder as the project grew to keep things as specific as possible, but I never got to the point where I couldn't make more progress. 
I had a ton of fun, this app brings me a lot of joy to use, but I don't think this is good code. 
I wanna think this was like me pair programming with a junior eng driving as I navigated, but I had to intercept a whole bunch. If I thought about it that way it was fun and coachable. 
As for the experience, I found myself trying to understand the code written by this thing most of the time so I could get in there and fix the bugs. This tracks with reviewing a junior's code. 
I would like to get this app to the point that it becomes truly unmaintainable though, and see what it's like to run better models also. 
This was a great learning experience
